# Student_Tracker
Welcome to the Spring MVC CRUD Application for Teachers! This project showcases the fundamental principles of Spring MVC while providing a comprehensive platform for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The application is designed to cater specifically to teachers, allowing them to efficiently manage records with utmost security.

# Features
Authentication: The application prioritizes security by implementing a robust authentication mechanism. Teachers are required to log in with their credentials before gaining access to the system's functionalities.

Create: Authorized teachers can create new records within the application. This allows for the seamless addition of important information while maintaining data accuracy.

Read: The application provides teachers with the ability to read and access existing records. This feature ensures that relevant information is easily retrievable when needed.

Update: Teachers are empowered to update records as necessary. Whether it's modifying contact details or other pertinent information, the update feature facilitates accurate data management.

Delete: With proper authorization, teachers can safely remove records that are no longer relevant or required. This assists in maintaining a clutter-free and efficient database.
